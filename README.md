# Break-the-Cipher (currently under development)

It is an educational project which aims to help anyone learn the Caesar, Playfair, Fiestel and DES ciphers in a practical way. It will contain theoretical explainations and along with it fun games which make the idea of decrypting a cipher more intuitive.
