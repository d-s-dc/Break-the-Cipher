# Break-the-Cipher (currently under development)

It is an educational project which aims to help anyone learn the Caesar, Playfair, Fiestel and DES ciphers in a practical way. It will contain theoretical explainations and along with it fun games which make the idea of decrypting a cipher more intuitive.

I'm also planning to put some interesting data visualizations to help understand it better. For a while I have done some other fun stuff on data visualization using numpy, pandas, seaborn and other libraries you can check it out [here](https://github.com/d-s-dc/Data-Visualizations-for-fun)
